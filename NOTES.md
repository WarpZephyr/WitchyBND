Important: These next releases continue to improve early support for Shadow of the Erdtree. However, you are advised to NOT do any modding work on existing projects while things are in flux.

There is a high likelihood of Witchy corrupting files or providing incomplete data, which in turn can irrevocably damage edited files.

These builds are primarily intended for datamining purposes.

* Set the "Flexible" feature to Off. This feature skipped important sanity checks which were abused by malicious actors like Garden of Eyes, but are once again important for working with potentially broken DLC files.
  * It can be re-enabled in options at your own risk.
* Fixed some issues with the MSB parser.
* Added some failsafes for text output crashing the actual process.
* Updated Paramdex to the latest from Smithbox.
