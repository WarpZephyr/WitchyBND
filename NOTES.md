Important: These next releases continue to improve early support for Shadow of the Erdtree. However, you are advised to NOT do any modding work on existing projects while things are in flux.

There is a high likelihood of Witchy corrupting files or providing incomplete data, which in turn can irrevocably damage edited files.

These builds are primarily intended for datamining purposes.

* Improved MSBE serialization.
