* Added specialized BND handling for ANIBND4. Unpacking and repacking these files will not require you to manage the file list for HKX and TAE.
  * This is well-tested for ELDEN RING, and lightly tested with BB. Testing in other games is welcome. 
  * As a reminder, specialized binder handling can be turned off in the configuration, or via commandline.
* Fixed many issues with the Recursive and Preprocess systems. Recursive operations should now overall be more reliable.
* Fixed issues that occurred when using the Recursive and Location options together.
* Attempted a fix for an updater issue with WitchyBND.Shell.dll.
