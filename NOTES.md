* Fixed assorted issues with the special ANIBND4 handling across different types of ANIBND in different games.
* Fixed an issue with the special FFXBND handling where empty FFXRESLISTs would try to be created for FFXBND archives that don't have them, such as Sekiro's or DS3's FFXBND.
* Updated SoulsFormatsNEXT.
