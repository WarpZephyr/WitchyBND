* Added "Unpack TAE to folder" option, set to True by default.
  * Enabling this option will unpack TAE files into a folder of XMLs, one for each animation.
  * Disabling it will serialize the TAE, with all constituent animations, into a single XML.
* Witchy will now throw an error when a deferred tool tries to ask for user input.
