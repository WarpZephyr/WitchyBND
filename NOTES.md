* Updated ACVI paramdefs to Vawser's latest version.
* Applied a temporary solution to an issue that prevented some AC6 PARAMs from being read. Thanks to Vawser for the method.
* Fixed an issue with reading some AC6 TPFs with a Flags1 value of 128, specifically Global Illumination GIIV TPFs. The DDS inside are still unreadable, though.
