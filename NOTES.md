* Changed the DCX behavior. If Witchy cannot find a valid parser for a DCX-compressed file, it will now decompress the DCX instead of doing nothing.
* Changed the method Witchy uses to restart the Explorer process, to hopefully fix some unreproducible issues.
* Added some minor error handling to the Paramdex unzipping process.
