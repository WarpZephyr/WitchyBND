* Added specialized BND handling for ANIBND. Unpacking and repacking it will not require you to manage the file list for HKX and TAE.
  * This is only tested for ELDEN RING. Testing in other games is welcome. 
  * As a reminder, specialized binder handling can be turned off in the configuration, or via commandline.
