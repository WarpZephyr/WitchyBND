* Migrated WitchyBND to use [SoulsFormatsNEXT](https://github.com/soulsmods/SoulsFormatsNEXT).
* Changed the "Flexible extraction" setting default to True. This will not apply to existing installs.
  * As a reminder, this setting foregoes some important format integrity checks in order to counteract malicious actors intentionally corrupting their files.
* Updated Paramdex to the latest from Smithbox, including support for the latest regulation.
