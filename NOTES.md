* Updated WitchyBND to the latest version of SoulsFormatsNEXT, with several improvements courtesy of Shadowth117:
  * Console TPFs now unpack and repack correctly (TODO: PS3 DeS). WitchyBND should now be usable in place of DeSBNDBuild for working with console files.
  * Improved handling for malformed ELDEN RING cubemap DDS files.
