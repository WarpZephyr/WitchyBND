* Updated to latest Paramdex, including support for 1.13.2.
* When missing FFXRESLIST entries, the FFXBND parser will no longer print the full list of IDs, only the amount.
* Improved handling for completely empty FFXBNDs.
* Fixed an issue where Witchy would keep going through available parsers if an error occurred inside of one, even though the file matched a parser.
